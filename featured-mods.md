Wireless Item Passaging is a mod that allows wireless item transportation. No longer will you need a bunch of conduits to transport over long distances. Instead, you can create Item Conduits from Wireless Item Passaging, set their locations to pull from, and save tons of space! With an easy to use InventoryType system, addons are simple and painless, letting mod compatibility be as easy as one line of code.

## 2ND PLACE: Per-User Difficulty by CandiceJoy ##

Implements per-user difficulty levels for servers.  The config file allows server owners to specify damage taken and damage dealt multipliers for each of 3 difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard).  There's also a disable difficulty to disable the mod on a per-user basis. 

You can also configure the max difficulty that allows keepInvnentory (the server must have keepInventory on for this to work properly).  To user this mod, simply /setdifficulty easy or whatever level you want.  It will store your difficulty to your player.dat and will only let you change your difficulty once per hour (by default; this is configurable).
